# Byssinosis
 STA 138 project

In this report, we were given a data set about Byssinosis, a rare lung disease  that workers contracted due to the cotton dust in 1973. This data set consisted of 5,419 subjects based on their type of work, employment years, smoking, sex, race, and whether they had byssinosis or not. Our task was to discover if there was any association between these factors and byssinosis.

Included is a pdf of the report and the code for this project
